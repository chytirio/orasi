# Query Plan Generation

The Bridge API provides sophisticated query plan generation capabilities that analyze, optimize, and plan the execution of telemetry data queries. This system helps optimize query performance and provides detailed insights into how queries will be executed.

## Overview

The query planner is a comprehensive system that:

- **Analyzes Query Characteristics**: Examines query type, filters, aggregations, and time ranges
- **Selects Execution Strategies**: Chooses the most efficient execution approach
- **Estimates Costs**: Calculates resource usage including I/O, CPU, and network costs
- **Identifies Optimizations**: Finds opportunities to improve query performance
- **Plans Execution Steps**: Creates a detailed step-by-step execution plan
- **Determines Parallelism**: Identifies opportunities for parallel execution

## Execution Strategies

The query planner supports several execution strategies, automatically selected based on query characteristics:

### 1. Time Series Scan
**Best for**: Simple queries with minimal filtering
- Direct sequential scan through time-series data
- Optimal for recent data access patterns
- Supports both forward and backward scanning

### 2. Index Lookup
**Best for**: Queries with high-selectivity filters
- Leverages indexes for efficient data retrieval
- Supports time indexes, field indexes, and composite indexes
- Significantly reduces data scanning overhead

### 3. Aggregation Push
**Best for**: Queries with large time ranges and aggregations
- Pushes aggregations down to the storage layer
- Uses pre-aggregated data when available
- Supports multiple aggregation levels (row, minute, hour, day)

### 4. Multi-Stage Execution
**Best for**: Complex analytics queries
- Breaks complex queries into manageable stages
- Optimizes each stage independently
- Provides fine-grained resource control

## Query Optimizations

The planner automatically identifies and applies various optimizations:

### Filter Pushdown
- Moves filter operations closer to data sources
- Reduces the amount of data transferred
- Improves overall query performance

### Aggregation Pushdown
- Executes aggregations at the storage layer
- Minimizes data movement
- Leverages pre-computed aggregations when available

### Index Selection
- Automatically selects the most efficient indexes
- Considers filter selectivity and query patterns
- Balances index overhead with scan reduction

### Time Range Optimization
- Optimizes large time range queries
- Suggests pre-aggregated data usage
- Partitions data access for efficiency

### Caching Strategy
- Identifies cacheable query patterns
- Determines optimal cache TTL values
- Balances cache hits with data freshness

## Cost Estimation

The query planner provides detailed cost estimates:

### Resource Usage
- **Estimated Rows Scanned**: Number of rows that need to be examined
- **Estimated Rows Returned**: Number of rows in the final result
- **Memory Usage**: Estimated memory consumption in MB
- **Execution Time**: Predicted query execution time

### Cost Components
- **I/O Cost**: Cost of data access operations
- **CPU Cost**: Computational overhead (especially for aggregations)

## Execution Steps

Each query plan includes detailed execution steps:

### Step Types
1. **Scan**: Data source scanning with conditions
2. **Filter**: Apply filter conditions
3. **Aggregate**: Execute aggregation functions
4. **Sort**: Sort results by specified columns
5. **Limit**: Apply result limits and offsets

### Step Metadata
- **Cost Estimation**: Individual step costs
- **Row Estimates**: Expected rows processed

## API Usage

### Generate Query Plan

The query plan is automatically generated for each query and included in the response metadata:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "results": { ... },
    "metadata": {
      "query_id": "uuid",
      "execution_time_ms": 145,
      "result_count": 1000,
      "cache_hit": false,
      "query_plan": "=== Query Execution Plan... ==="
    }
  }
}
```

println!("Generated plan: {}", plan.unwrap_or_default());
```

### Analyzing Query Costs

```rust
// The query plan includes detailed cost information
// that can be used for monitoring and optimization
if plan.contains("High cost detected") {
    // Consider query optimization
}
```

The query plan generation system provides a powerful foundation for understanding and optimizing telemetry data queries, ensuring optimal performance across different query patterns and data volumes.
