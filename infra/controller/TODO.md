## üêõ Known Issues

- [ ] **Metrics Integration** - Prometheus metrics need proper integration with metrics-exporter-prometheus
- [ ] **Signal Handling** - Unix signal handling could be improved for production use
- [ ] **Error Handling** - Some error types need better integration with Kubernetes errors
- [ ] **Documentation** - API documentation needs to be generated and published

## üìù Notes

- The current implementation is a simplified version focused on demonstrating the controller pattern
- Kubernetes integration was removed to avoid compilation issues but should be re-added for production use
- The controller follows the kube-rs controller-rs example pattern but adapted for the Orasi workspace
- All dependencies are sourced from the workspace where possible to maintain consistency
